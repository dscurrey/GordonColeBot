COOP! THEY SAY THAT LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND, MAKES PEOPLE WHO NEED PEOPLE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER SAID A DOGGONE THING ABOUT A CURE FOR HEARING LOSS.
IT IS THRILLING, DENISE
THERE'S ROOM IN THIS FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION FOR MORE THAN ONE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, DENISE.
I WISH TO ENGAGE YOU IN AN ANECDOTE OF NO SMALL AMUSEMENT.
WOULD YOU PLEASE ASK THE LADY WITH THE LOG TO SPEAK UP?

Shelly, you are a miracle worker and a goddess sent from heaven.
THEY SAY THAT LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND, MAKES PEOPLE WHO NEED PEOPLE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
COOP!
SHE’S A RARE AND PRECIOUS INDIVIDUAL, DON’T YOU THINK?
Shelly turn around and face me a moment before I lose my nerve. I’m about ready to leave Twin Peaks and I don’t know when I’m gonna return but I want you to know that meeting you has been more than a privilege, you touched my heart and I know that if I don’t kiss you now I’m gonna regret it the rest of my days.
AS HAPPY AS THIS NEWS MAKES US, ALBERT, WE CAN'T PUT THIS ON THE RADIO.
IT'S COOPER. THEY FOUND HIM.
SOUTH DAKOTA, DENISE. HE'S IN A FEDERAL PRISON IN SOUTH DAKOTA. WE'RE GOING OUT TO SEE HIM TOMORROW.
YES? HOW'S THAT?
I'M OLD SCHOOL, DENISE. YOU KNOW THAT. BEFORE YOU WERE DENISE, WHEN YOU WERE DENNIS AND I WAS YOUR BOSS, WHEN I HAD YOU WORKING UNDERCOVER AT THE DEA, YOU WERE A CONFUSED AND WILD THING SOMETIMES. I HAD ENOUGH DIRT ON YOU TO FILL THE GRAND CANYON - AND I NEVER USED A SPOONFUL BECAUSE YOU WERE AND ARE A GREAT AGENT. AND WHEN YOU BECAME DENISE, I TOLD ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES, THOSE CLOWN COMICS, TO FIX THEIR HEARTS OR DIE.
APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE FOR ALBERT.
OH.
WE ARE LIKE THE DREAMER WHO DREAMS AND THEN LIVES INSIDE THE DREAM.
I COULDN'T DO IT, ALBERT. I COULDN'T DO IT.
WHAT?
